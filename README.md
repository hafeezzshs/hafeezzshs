<p align="left">
🌱 I’m a self-taught developer from India 🇮🇳 exploring the <strong>DevOps journey</strong> — blending development, deployment, and cloud to build things that <i>just work</i>.
  
💡 I love turning ideas into real, working setups — from coding features to making sure they run smoothly in production.

🌐 I enjoy crafting clean and minimal UIs, learning how systems connect, and improving how apps get built and delivered.

🧰 Constantly experimenting with new tools, exploring how they fit into real workflows, and keeping my setups <i>super organized</i> — neat, structured, and a little OCD about it 😅

🔭 Currently building an <strong>enterprise-level Full-Stack project</strong> integrated with <strong>AI-powered features</strong>, and planning to scale it for a potential <strong>public release</strong> once it clicks 🚀

⚙️ On a mission to grow into a <strong>skilled DevOps Engineer</strong> — someone who understands both the code and the cloud.
